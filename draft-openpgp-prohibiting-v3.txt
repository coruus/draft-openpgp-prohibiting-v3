1.  Introduction

   OpenPGP, as defined by [RFC4880] permits the use of unsafe packet
   types for compatibility with legacy implementations.  This document
   requires that OpenPGP implementations immediately stop supporting
   these packet types.

1.1.  V3 keys

   The version 3 public/private key format specified by [RFC2440] has a
   number of weaknesses.  In particular:

   o  keyids are derived as the low-order bits of the public RSA
      modulus;

   o  fingerprints are calculated as the MD5(modulus || exponent).

   As a result, version 3 keyids and fingerprints are trivially
   spoofable.  Details of these attacks are summarized in TODO.

   In addition, version 3 keyids and version 4 keyids are both 64 bits.
   Both V3 and V4 keyids are usually formatted and handled by
   implementations in the same way as version 4 keyids.  This means that
   users of OpenPGP implementations cannot assure that they are using a
   version 4 keyid (which is modestly costly to forge) or a version 3
   keyid (which is trivial to forge).

   The continued use of version 3 keys thus represents a security risk
   to all users of OpenPGP software.

1.2.  Modification detection codes

   [RFC4880] specified tag 18 and 19 symmetrically-encrypted, integrity-
   protected data packets and message modification codes.  The MDC
   provides some protection against message modification attacks.
   Attacks against non-integrity-protected packets have been
   demonstrated that reduce the security of OpenPGP implementations to
   under 2^16 bits.  See [jallad], [mister], [lin], and [klima].  (TODO:
   encrux already done?)

   OpenPGP implementations have supported MDCs for over 10 years.
   [pgp81relnote] [gnupg106relnote] [mccune].  [RFC6637] already
   requires the use of MDCs with message compositions including an ECDH
   (tag ??) packet.

1.3.  Private key modification attacks

   [lin], and [klima].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Changes to OpenPGP

   Because of the deficiencies noted in Section 1:

   1.  OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT import V3 key packets.

   2.  OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT verify signatures made using a
       V3 key.

   3.  OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT generate or decrypt (Tag 9)
       unauthenticated encrypted data packets.  They MUST use Tag 18
       packets with MDCs.  If the stated preferences of the recipient
       conflict, they MUST disregard the recipient"s preferences.

   4.  OpenPGP implementations MUST use ONLY the secret-key S2K usage
       octet 254, as described in [RFC4880] section 5.5.3.

   [RFC4880] and [RFC6637] list the packet types defined for OpenPGP

4.  Limited exceptions

4.1.  Decrypting existing files

   Notwithstanding the requirements of this document, an implementation
   MAY provide the option to decrypt existing data encrypted under a V3
   key or using a tag 9 packet.  These options MUST be separate; that
   is, enabling support for V3 keys SHALL NOT imply that support for tag
   9 packets is enabled, or vice versa.

   It MUST, however, disable this option by default.  It MUST require
   explicit user permission in order to so; it MUST NOT provide any
   perdurable configuration option to enable such support.

   In addition, an implementation MAY support converting an existing V3
   secret key into a V4 public key; if it does, it SHOULD offer to do so
   when the key material is stored in a way (e.g., on a smartcard) that
   prevents a new key from being generated.

5.  Implementation notes

5.1.  Calculating MDCs and verifying prefix correctness

   Implementations MUST NOT implement the "quick-check" comparison of
   the two repeated prefix bytes described in [RFC4880].

   Implementations SHOULD, however, check that the repeated prefix bytes
   are correct in the following way:

   1.  Decrypt the message, preserving (but not checking) the prefix
       bytes.

   2.  Calculate the MDC as described in section 5.13 of [RFC4880]

   3.  Concatenate the message"s MDC with the decrypted message bytes
       M[16:18].

   4.  Concatenate the calculated MDC with the decrypted message bytes
       M[14:16].

   5.  In constant-time, with respect to the number of differing bits
       between the purported and calculcated tags, compare the two MDCs.

   6.  If any bits differ, report an error.  The error message MUST NOT
       indicate the position or (or total number) of the bit
       differences.

   This provides up to an additional 16 bits of message-integrity
   protection against some types of attack. [cite to Rogaway KW paper?]

6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document enhances the security guarantees of OpenPGP by
   preventing downgrade and crossgrade attacks.
