  <abstract>
   <t>This document requires that OpenPGP implementations only generate and accept
        V4 OpenPGP key packets and MDC-protected encrypted data packets.</t>
  </abstract>
 </front>
 <middle>
  <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
   <t>OpenPGP, as defined by <xref target="RFC4880" /> permits the use of unsafe 
         packet types for compatibility with legacy implementations. This document
         requires that OpenPGP implementations immediately stop supporting these
         packet types.
       </t>
   <section anchor="v3keys" title="V3 keys">
    <t>The version 3 public/private key format specified by <xref target="RFC2440" />
          has a number of weaknesses. In particular:</t>
    <t>
     <list style="symbols">
      <t>keyids are derived as the low-order bits of the public RSA modulus;</t>
      <t>fingerprints are calculated as the MD5(modulus || exponent).</t>
     </list>
    </t>
    <t>As a result, version 3 keyids and fingerprints are trivially spoofable.
      Details of these attacks are summarized in TODO.
   </t>
    <t>In addition, version 3 keyids and version 4 keyids are both 64 bits. Both
      V3 and V4 keyids are usually formatted and handled by implementations in the
      same way as version 4 keyids. This means that users of OpenPGP implementations
      cannot assure that they are using a version 4 keyid (which is modestly costly
      to forge) or a version 3 keyid (which is trivial to forge).</t>
    <t>The continued use of version 3 keys thus represents a security risk to all
      users of OpenPGP software.
   </t>
   </section>
   <section anchor="mdc" title="Modification detection codes">
    <t>
     <xref target="RFC4880" /> specified tag 18 and 19 symmetrically-encrypted,
     integrity-protected data packets and message modification codes. The MDC
     provides some protection against message modification attacks. Attacks against
     non-integrity-protected packets have been demonstrated that reduce the security
     of OpenPGP implementations to under 2^16 bits. See <xref target="jallad" />, 
     <xref target="mister" />, [lin], and [klima].
     (TODO: encrux already done?)
   </t>
    <t>
     OpenPGP implementations have supported MDCs for over 10 years. [pgp81relnote]
     [gnupg106relnote] [mccune]. <xref target="RFC6637" /> already requires the
     use of MDCs with message compositions including an ECDH (tag ??) packet.

  <section title="Changes to OpenPGP">
   <t>Because of the deficiencies noted in <xref target="Introduction" />:</t>
   <t>
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT import V3 key packets.</t>
     <t>OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT verify signatures made using a V3 key.</t>
     <t>OpenPGP implementations MUST NOT generate or decrypt (Tag 9) unauthenticated
       encrypted data packets. They MUST use Tag 18 packets with MDCs. If the stated
       preferences of the recipient conflict, they MUST disregard the recipient"s
       preferences.</t>
     <t>OpenPGP implementations MUST use ONLY the secret-key S2K usage octet 254,
        as described in <xref target="RFC4880" /> section 5.5.3.</t>
    </list>
   </t>
   <t>
    <xref target="RFC4880" /> and <xref target="RFC6637" /> list the packet types defined for OpenPGP 
     </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Limited exceptions">
   <section title="Decrypting existing files">
    <t>Notwithstanding the requirements of this document, an implementation
         MAY provide the option to decrypt existing data encrypted under a V3
         key or using a tag 9 packet. These options MUST be separate; that is, enabling
         support for V3 keys SHALL NOT imply that support for tag 9 packets is
         enabled, or vice versa.
       </t>
    <t>It MUST, however, disable this option by default. It MUST require explicit
         user permission in order to so; it MUST NOT provide any perdurable 
         configuration option to enable such support.
       </t>
    <t>In addition, an implementation MAY support converting an existing V3
         secret key into a V4 public key; if it does, it SHOULD offer to do so
         when the key material is stored in a way (e.g., on a smartcard) that 
         prevents a new key from being generated.</t>
   </section>
  </section>
  <section title="Implementation notes">
   <section title="Calculating MDCs and verifying prefix correctness">
    <t>Implementations MUST NOT implement the "quick-check" comparison of the two
      repeated prefix bytes described in <xref target="RFC4880" />.
    </t>
    <t>Implementations SHOULD, however, check that the repeated prefix bytes are
      correct in the following way:
    </t>
    <t>
     <list style="numbers">
      <t>Decrypt the message, preserving (but not checking) the prefix bytes.</t>
      <t>Calculate the MDC as described in section 5.13 of <xref target="RFC4880" />
      </t>
      <t>Concatenate the message"s MDC with the decrypted message bytes M[16:18].</t>
      <t>Concatenate the calculated MDC with the decrypted message bytes M[14:16].</t>
      <t>In constant-time, with respect to the number of differing bits between the
        purported and calculcated tags, compare the two MDCs.</t>
      <t>If any bits differ, report an error. The error message MUST NOT indicate
         the position or (or total number) of the bit differences.</t>
     </list>
    </t>
    <t>This provides up to an additional 16 bits of message-integrity protection
      against some types of attack. [cite to Rogaway KW paper?]
